          a software engineer with a business degree.
          <br />
          <br />
          growing up in a remote village was pretty boring, and i learned to
          code as a way of entertaining myself after school. but the freedom to
          build anything that i wanted with odd looking english grammar was very
          thrilling to me. so naturally, i decided early that i wanted to make a
          career out of talking to metal boxes.
          <br />
          <br />
          took a business degree at uni, to make my apps magically print money.
          that one is still in the pipeline.
          <br />
          <br />
          professionally, i am looking for a software engineering role at in the
          london startup ecosystem.
          <br />
          personally, i&apos;m searching for a story that can beat my current
          favourite (one piece)
