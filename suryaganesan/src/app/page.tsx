          i&apos;m a software engineer with 2 years of experience building
          llm-based web applications using python, react and langchain. i am
          deeply passionate about <i>agentic ai</i> and its potential to solve
          hard problems. my goal is to work with similarly passionate teams
          tackling new challenges with software and become a better builder.
          <br />
          <br />
          one of my favourite things to do before building new ideas is to judge
          how important the problem i am solving is by having lots of
          conversations wilth potential users. i am most excited about projects
          that will solve painful problems for users. in my free time, i love
          immersing in great stories - anime, video games, movies, etc.
